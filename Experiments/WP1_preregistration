# Investigating the mapping between different spoken and written varieties of Norwegian
*Maud Westendorp, Björn Lundquist - October 2022*

### Description
The present study will investigate if, and to what extent, different spoken and written varieties of Norwegian overlap in the minds of different Norwegian speakers. Norwegian has (for historical reasons) two distinct written varieties: Bokmål and Nynorsk. As for spoken Norwegian, regional/local dialects are spoken in both private and public contexts; writing in dialect in private contexts is common practice; and both written varieties are taught in schools. In this study we aim to investigate the mapping between spoken and written varieties of Norwegian using an auditory–written sentence matching paradigm.

### Data collection

### Hypothesis
The present study will investigate if, and to what extent, different spoken and written varieties of Norwegian overlap in the minds of young Norwegian speakers. Norwegian has (for historical reasons) two distinct written standards: Bokmål and Nynorsk. As for spoken Norwegian, regional/local dialects are spoken in both private and public contexts; and writing in dialect in private contexts is common practice. All Norwegians are to a greater or lesser extent exposed to the spectrum of Norwegian dialects (which are all to an extent mutually intelligible), and both written varieties are taught in school. In this study we aim to investigate the mapping between spoken and written varieties of Norwegian. This study is exploratory, as – to our best knowledge – no previous work has been conducted that attempts to explicitly examine the connection between written and spoken modalities in Norwegian.

In a language like English or Swedish, written and spoken modalities are two ways of externalizing the same language. For Norwegian, it is less obvious that there is such a link. Norway has no official spoken standard, although the Eastern Norwegian dialect spoken in and around the capital, Oslo, arguably has a particular status (for discussion see e.g., Sandøy 2011). The written standard Bokmål is by far the most used written variety (85–90% of population uses this standard) and enjoys a similar status. 

In this study, participants will read and listen to sentences and asked whether or not the two match. When we hear English and read Norwegian, it is obvious that some translation is needed to decide whether the sentences are the same or not. Such a “translation” component would increase reaction time in this task. We examine if this is the case for hearing and reading different varieties of Norwegian too by presenting participants with auditory stimuli in two spoken varieties of Norwegian (one local, one non-local) combined with written stimuli in Bokmål and Nynorsk in a 2x2 design. We postulate that, if there is a link between the spoken and written varieties, speakers map their local dialect onto their dominant written language. Due to the geographical overlap as well as the overall status of the East Norwegian dialect and the written standard Bokmål, we also presume that these two varieties are connected in some way.

We hypothesise:
	+	Main effect of spoken and written varieties: Decreased reaction times when participants are presented with local dialect, or with their dominant written variety.
	+	Interaction of spoken variety and written standard: Decreased reaction times for combination of East Norwegian dialect with Bokmål, as well as local dialect in combination with dominant written variety.

### Dependent variable
Using an auditory–written sentence matching paradigm, the key dependent variables are: reaction time (i.e., how long does it take participants to decide whether the two sentences match or not) and error rates. 


### Conditions
We will use a 2 x 2 design (Spoken variety x Written standard) in which trials consist of an auditorily presented sentence (within subjects: local dialect, Eastern Norwegian), followed by a written sentence in one of the two Norwegian written standards (within subjects: Bokmål, Nynorsk). The task for participants is to indicate using response buttons whether the two sentences present a match (N = 32) or mismatch (N=16). Four versions of each sentence are created using a Latin square design (Spoken variety x Written Standard), and participants are divided over four lists of 48 items.

### Analyses 
The results will be analysed for accuracy and reaction time (RT) per condition. Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with random effects for participants and item, will be used to analyse the results. In our analysis, we will focus on the responses in the match condition (see also next point on exclusions). Two models will be fitted:
	•	Glmer with response as the dependent variable (correct/incorrect) to examine main effects of Spoken variety and Written standard and their interactions.
	•	Glmer with reaction time as the dependent variable (RTs will be transformed to correct for non-normal distributions) to examine main effects of Spoken variety and Written standard and their interactions.

### Outliers and Exclusions 
We will compute participants' individual mean reaction times per condition and exclude responses at 2.5 SD above the mean. The mismatch condition is used to sort out participants, i.e., we will exclude all data from participants that do not detect a mismatch in more than 50% of the mismatch items. 

### Sample size
We have set up an arrangement to visit a middle school in western Norway and will collect data there in October 2022. We aim to get at least 100 participants from this school. If we are not able to get to this number of participants, we will continue to make additional appointments with schools until we have a minimum of 100 participants, or until July 2023 (whichever comes first).
We will compare the western Norwegian participants with participants in eastern Norway. This data collection is not yet planned, but we aim to get the same number of participants to make a reasonable comparison. We have the intention to collect this data before the end of 2023. 

### Other
This experiment is part of a larger collaborative research project (https://www.hvl.no/en/multilit).  Included in the larger project is a battery of questions for exploratory purposes that aims to get a solid idea of the participants’ language background and proficiency (e.g., language use in school/home/free time etc.). Data from other experiments in the larger project will also be shared among the researchers and may inform the results of our study.
